=== **The Process of HTTP Transmission** ===
 **HTTP**, whose full name is "Hypertext Transfer Protocol", is a application-layer protocol.

Here is a simple introduction to transmission of HTTP.

 # A HTTP server set up all the sockets and waiting for clients to connect.
 # When a client ask for connecting to the server, the server accept the information from client. One example of information:

{{{
#!text

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
}}}
 In the first line, "GET" is one of HTTP request methods (all methods is enclose below), "/index.html" is a resource which is requesting, "HTTP/1.1" is the version of HTTP.

 The second line, "Host" is the remote server client requesting for.

 # After accepting the information from client, the server will read the resource the client requesting and response to the client. If there is no the resource, return a 404 ERROR CODE.


=== **HTTP request methods** ===
 # GET
  ** "GET" method is get the resource in the internet.
 # HEAD
 # POST
  ** "POST" method will post information(mostly from a FORM) to the remote server.
 # PUT
 # DELETE
 # TRACE
 # OPTIONS
 # CONNECT
 # PATCH
